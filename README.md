# Project for my Summer Internship at ECL, 2024  

  I was one amongst multiple people interning at ECL that Summer, and yet there was only one official formally appointed to supervise our work. That would've been enough honestly, except all the supervision was manual!     
  
  I would have to wait till he wasn't clearly busy with some other work. Then I had to make sure that me showing my work to him didn't clash with the plans of the other interns planning on doing the same (I'm a team player). Then I'd have to physically carry my laptop to his cubicle and get the work approved.    
  
  And I own a bulky gaming laptop that dies if it is unplugged for more than -3 nanoseconds. There had to be a better way.    
  
  That, is the origin story behind me opting to work on an intern management dashboard which could do all of the above, just digitally.
